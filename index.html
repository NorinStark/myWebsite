			Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web applications. Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce sites like Amazon.The good news is that learning web development is not that hard!In fact, many argue it’s the best form of coding for beginners to learn. It’s easy to set up, you get instant results and there’s plenty of online training available.A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the next Facebook or find a job in the industry. But it’s also a good choice if you just want a general introduction to coding, since it’s super easy to get started. No matter whether you’re looking for a career or just want to learn coding, learning how to develop for the web is for you. It’s one of the smartest decisions you will ever make!

			<h2>Web Development Overview</h2>
			<p>There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).<br>

			Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>

			HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that’s widely used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages.
			<br>
			Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.
			<br>
			Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such as... PHP, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, Perl, JAVA, Node.js, Python.</p>
